This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua error handling, specifically when dealing with nil arguments. The `bug.lua` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version.  The issue lies in how the `error` function is used; it stops execution abruptly and might not provide the best debugging experience. The solution improves clarity and error handling.
